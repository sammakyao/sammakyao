## Hi there 👋

Hi there! I'm **Samwel Makyao**.

🔭 Prev a **Software Engineering Intern at Intuit Credit Karma** where, I built Recs Lens, Credit Karma's first internal Slack-native AI agent that interprets and debugs production 
logs for systems delivering 3.8B+ monthly personalized recommendations, contributing to ~80% of CK's revenue. It reduced debugging time from 2 hours to 30 seconds and now 
supports 22+ stakeholders across Engineering, Product, and Data Science. 
🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at the **University of North Texas**.
🤝 I love collaborating on **AI/ML**, **UI/UX**, **Web Accessibility** and **Full Stack Development** projects that operate at scale.

## What I'm Working On 👋

🔭 I’m currently building a first AI health agent and one stop center for everything agentic health, working collaboratively with health professionals, family networks groups, and researchers. 
Having experienced preterm birth from family members, I'm motivate to build this free tool that will help everyone and everywhere. I believe that everyone should have a fair opportunity to be 
as healthy as possible by removing obstacles like poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to quality education, housing, and healthcare
🔭 I’m also working with a team of five to revolutionize productivity apps by creating what we believe is the most efficient productivity app for everyone.
